## Overview and Motivation

In this project, we designed the UX/UI for **RobinAI**, a tool aimed at simplifying data exploration for business users through intuitive visualizations. Following a human-centered design process, we developed personas, created prototypes, and conducted usability tests to ensure a seamless user experience.

## Prototyping Process

We moved from **paper prototypes** to high-fidelity designs in **Figma**, focusing on key tasks like data visualization, exploration, and sharing insights.

## User Testing and Evaluation

Using the **think-aloud method**, we gathered feedback on navigation and interactivity. The results led to improvements in usability, including the addition of navigation aids and a more interactive data exploration interface.

## Key Learnings

- **Iterative Prototyping**: Each iteration brought new insights into improving user experience.
- **User-Centered Design**: Understanding user needs through research and testing was key to creating intuitive designs.
- **Navigation and Usability**: Ensuring smooth navigation was crucial for data exploration tasks.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to our instructors and peers for their support throughout the project, and to our users for their valuable feedback during testing.
